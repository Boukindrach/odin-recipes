        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (29 ounce) can sweet potatoes, drained</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups miniature marshmallows</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>the syrup:</strong> This is a key move so your candied yams don't turn out runny due to too much liquid in the baking dish.<br> Place the drained yams into a medium baking dish.</li>
            <li><strong>Dice the butter:</strong> Cut the cold butter into small pieces and distribute them evenly over the yams.</li>
            <li><strong>Sprinkle the brown sugar:</strong> Measure the brown sugar by packing it firmly into the measuring cup.<br> Then transfer it to a bowl to break it up and make it easier to sprinkle.<br> This is a good opportunity to crush any lumps in the brown sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Cover with mini marshmallows:</strong> This is where you might use more than the amount of marshmallows called for in the recipe, depending on how much surface area you're covering.<br> You want them pretty close together so they'll make that signature toasted marshmallow topping that marshmallow-lovers love.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Because the yams are fully cooked already, what you're really doing is heating them up and toasting the marshmallows until they're golden and melty.</li>
        </ol>
